#### Account Abstraction
Airetos leverages [account abstraction](/docs/reference/account-abstraction), a concept that decouples user accounts from the underlying Ethereum accounts. This enables the creation of smart contract-based accounts with custom logic, unlocking new possibilities for blockchain applications.

#### Extensible Services
By bundling primary transactions with auxiliary transactions for additional services, the Airetos bundler allows dApps to integrate various services seamlessly. This approach facilitates the inclusion of KYT, KYC, and other compliance or value-added services into blockchain transactions.

#### Multiple Service Providers
The Airetos is designed to support multiple service providers, fostering competition and innovation in the ecosystem. Users can select their preferred providers for KYT, KYC, or other services, promoting decentralization and choice.

#### Developer-Friendly SDK
The JavaScript SDK abstracts away the complexities of account abstraction and the Airetos bundler, providing a streamlined developer experience. Developers can integrate the required functionality into their dApps with minimal effort, accelerating the adoption of these new capabilities.
